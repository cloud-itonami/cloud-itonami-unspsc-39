  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the independent solar and EV-charging
  install-and-diagnostics coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only          -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake    -- diagnostic-reading logging allowed,
                                    every write needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordinate -- adds safety-concern flags and
                                    commissioning-record proposals,
                                    still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised-auto    -- adds repair/install-visit
                                    scheduling (still always approval
                                    -- see below); governor-clean,
                                    high-confidence `:log-diagnostic-
                                    reading` (no physical/financial
                                    risk) may auto-commit.

  `:schedule-repair` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's `:auto`
  set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a rollout
  milestone still to come. Scheduling a real repair/install visit
  means a qualified electrician is actually dispatched to a site; it
  is always a human coordinator's call. `elecinstall.governor`'s
  `circuit-actuate-blocked-violations` HARD-blocks actuate attempts
  unconditionally, and the confidence/high-stakes gate independently
  never lets `:flag-safety-concern` auto-commit either -- multiple
  independent layers agree on where this actor's authority ends. Like
  every prior sibling's phase-3 `:auto` set, this domain has only ONE
  member (`:log-diagnostic-reading`) -- no separate no-risk lifecycle
  distinct from ordinary record logging.")
